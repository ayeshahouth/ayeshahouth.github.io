Welcome to my Portfolio Website!
This repository contains the source code and assets for my personal portfolio page, where I showcase some of my projects and skills. You can visit the page at https://ayeshahouth.github.io and learn more about me and my work.

The portfolio page is built using the HTML5up template Dimension from the html5up.net website. The page consists of four sections: Intro, Work, About and Contact.

The Main page displays my name and title. The Intro section has a short summary of who I am and what I do. The Work section showcases some of the projects that I have worked on or contributed to, with embed pdf files, and descriptions. The About section provides information about the wesite. The Contact section can be used to connect with me on social media platforms such as LinkedIn, and GitHub.

I hope you enjoy browsing my portfolio page and feel free to reach out to me if you have any questions, feedback or suggestions. Thank you for your interest!
